FairDM Geo Metadata

This module is deprecated. Model metadata is now defined in config.py
using the modern ModelMetadata, Authority, and Citation classes from
fairdm.registry.

For reference, the legacy metadata:
- Authority: FairDM Geo Development Team
- Website: https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm-geo
- Repository: https://github.com/FAIR-DM/fairdm-geo
- Keywords: earth_science

This file is retained for backwards compatibility but should not be used
in new code. See fairdm_geo/config.py for current metadata definitions.

# Legacy metadata - DO NOT USE
# Use Authority and Citation from fairdm.registry instead
# See config.py for examples
