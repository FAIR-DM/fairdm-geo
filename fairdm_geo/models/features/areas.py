This area is delineated based on specific research objectives, environmental characteristics, or spatial patterns of interest, and is described by a set of coordinates that outline its perimeter. The sampling area includes information on its geographic extent, access routes, environmental conditions, and the times and dates of sampling activities. By capturing a range of conditions across a broader geographic context, a sampling area provides a more comprehensive understanding of the variability and distribution of the phenomena being studied."
